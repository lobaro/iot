## Description

Battery-powered gateway for regular remote reading of up to 650...800 wireless M-Bus (868 MHz) and Sensus RF consumption
meters (e.g. water meters, heat cost allocators) via NB-IoT, LTE-M mobile radio or LoRaWAN to the Internet. Suitable for
indoor and weather-protected outdoor installation. Ideal for intra-year consumption information (uVI) and billing in the
housing industry.

### Features

* wM-Bus meter data upload via NB-IoT or LTE-M mobile radio (nano SIM card)
* Secure DTLS data transmission (client + server certificates) via mobile radio
* Alternative upload via LoRaWAN 1.0.2 (EU-868)
* Compatible with wireless M-BUS S1, C1/T1 modes (868 MHz) meters
* Compatible with Xylem Sensus RF Bubble Up (868 MHz)
* Compatible with MÃ¼ller Funk (ME protocol, Walk-By) for Âµon and Âµflow skyW-2 and skyE-2
* Internal 50 kByte memory, e.g. for 650 counter telegrams of 70 bytes each
* On request: variant with extra memory to support more than 2500 counter telegrams.
* Remote configuration: transmission intervals, filter: meter ID, manufacturer, device type
* Signed firmware updates (FOTA) via mobile radio
* Battery: 3.6V lithium thionyl chloride battery (D-cell)
* IP65 housing (Spelsberg, TG PC 1208-6-o): 122 mm (l) x 82mm (w) x 55mm (h)

## Product Identification

<Image alt='Label Wireless M-BUS Gateway V3 (Battery)'
img={require('./img/labelv3.png')}
style={{width: '25%', paddingTop: '10px', paddingBottom: '10px'}}/>

* Name: **Wireless M-Bus Gateway V3 (Battery)**
* Type: **LOB-GW-HYB-WMBUS**
* MPN / Ordering code: `8000162`

### Variants

The product is available in some variants:

#### embedded SIM (eSIM)

Instead of an integrated circuit located on a removable SIM card, typically made of PVC, an eSIM consists of software
installed onto an eUICC chip permanently attached to the gateway PCB. Advantages are the avoidance of corresive contacts in challenging outdoor environments.

* MPN / Ordering code: `8000184`

style={{width: '40%', paddingTop: '10px', paddingBottom: '10px'}}/>

1. Battery connector (XH)
2. SIM card socket (4FF - nano)
3. Reset button
4. Status LED (Blue, Green, Red)
5. Connector for [USB configuration adapter](/configuration/usb-config-adapter.md)
6. MicroSD card socket (unused by firmware)
7. Connector for internal PCB antenna
8. 3.6V D-Cell battery incl. loop tape
9. Pressure compensation element (PCE)

### LED signal patterns

The device has 3 three LEDs (B, G, R = Blue, Green, Red), labeled `Status` on the PCB: ðŸ”µðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´.

See also item [item (4)](#insideview) of internal view.

#### Patterns during booting/restart

* ðŸ”µâšªðŸ”´ B and R on: Device is in Bootloader Mode (not actively running, remove config adapter press reset to leave
  Bootloader Mode).
* âšªðŸŸ¢âšª G on for ~2s and off again: Device just booted, either after power on, reset b button or software, or after a hard
  failure.
* âšªâšªðŸ”´ R flashes repeatedly on and off in 1s interval: critical failure during boot (failed to start application).

#### Patterns during normal operation

* ðŸ”µâšªâšª B flashes 1s on and 1s off in loop: building LTE connection to mobile provider. Followed by:
    * âšªðŸŸ¢âšª Short G flash on success.
    * âšªâšªðŸ”´ Short R flash after connection failed.
* There are no patterns during normal LoRaWAN operation.

#### Exceptional patterns

* ðŸ”µâšªðŸ”´/âšªðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´ Quickly changing between R & B and G & B every 5s in a loop: Modem is in connection restriction mode - keep
  device on power, will fix itself after 30min.
