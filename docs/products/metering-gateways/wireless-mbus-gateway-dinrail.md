### Device Components{#devicecomponents}
<Image alt='Gateway V3 Internal Components'
img={require('./img/GW_V3_Internal_Components.png')}
style={{width: '40%', paddingTop: '10px', paddingBottom: '10px'}}/>

1. Battery connector (XH)
2. SIM card socket (4FF - nano)
3. Reset button
4. Status LED (Blue, Green, Red)
5. Connector for [USB configuration adapter](/configuration/usb-config-adapter.md)
6. MicroSD card socket (unused by firmware)
7. Connector for internal PCB antenna
8. 3.6V D-Cell battery incl. loop tape 
9. Pressure compensation element (PCE)

### LED signal patterns

The device has 3 three LEDs (B, G, R = Blue, Green, Red), labeled `Status` on the PCB: ðŸ”µðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´. 

See also item [(4)](#devicecomponents) under device components listing.

#### Patterns during booting/restart

* ðŸ”µâšªðŸ”´ B and R on: Device is in Bootloader Mode (not actively running, remove config adapter press reset to leave
  Bootloader Mode).
* âšªðŸŸ¢âšª G on for ~2s and off again: Device just booted, either after power on, reset b button or software, or after a hard
  failure.
* âšªâšªðŸ”´ R flashes repeatedly on and off in 1s interval: critical failure during boot (failed to start application).

#### Patterns during normal operation

* ðŸ”µâšªâšª B flashes 1s on and 1s off in loop: building LTE connection to mobile provider. Followed by:
    * âšªðŸŸ¢âšª Short G flash on success.
    * âšªâšªðŸ”´ Short R flash after connection failed.
* There are no patterns during normal LoRaWAN operation.

#### Exceptional patterns

* ðŸ”µâšªðŸ”´/âšªðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´ Quickly changing between R & B and G & B every 5s in a loop: Modem is in connection restriction mode - keep
  device on power, will fix itself after 30min.
