    * Wrapping `slog.Logger`, but also supplying some `logrus` functions (`WithError()`, `WithFields()`, Â´...) for compatibility
    * Added functions for dynamically changing logging settings
    * Unifying Log levels, to make a future change of the logging backend easier
* Device Type Side Menu uses cached queries for device counts - frontend caches for 1 minute - backend caches for 5 minutes and invalidates cache if new devices are created

### Removed

### Changed

* Updated mbus lib to v1.11.2
* Output of key fingerprint in parsed telegram output
* Reworked Device Types Menu on left side of Device Types and Data Page
