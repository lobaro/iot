# Server Certificates

The server needs certificates for different use cases. 

## HTTPS (Frontend)

The frontend is always serves via HTTP. To setup HTTPS connections to the Platform Frontend you will need a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache.

By default we setup an nginx using docker together with the [let's encrypt companion](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) to provide HTTPS.

## CoAPs (Devices)

Devices can used secure CoAPs connections to the backend. To use CoAPs a Certificate signed by Lobaro is required.


The setup consists of the following steps:

1. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
2. Request a Certificate from Lobaro
3. Install the signed Certificate in the Platform




### Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

#### Create Private Key

The key must be created at the Platform server and should never leave the system.

    openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out platform.key

:::error
Do not send the resulting private key file `platform.key` to anyone.
:::

#### Create CSR

Update "-subj" parameter in the command below according to you server and organisation.

* C is Country Name: e.g. `C=DE`
* ST is State or Province Name (full name): e.g. `ST=Hamburg`
* O is Organization Name (eg, company): e.g. `O=Lobaro GmbH`
* CN is Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name): e.g. `CN=up.lobaro.com`
    * The CN **must** match your domain that is configured in the devices. It can also be an IP address.



```bash
openssl req -new -key platform.key -sha256 -subj "/C=DE/ST=Hamburg/O=Lobaro GmbH/CN=up.lobaro.com" -out "platform.csr"
```

Verify your request with:

```bash
    openssl req -text -noout -in platform.csr
```

### Request Certificate from Lobaro

Send the generated CSR file (**platform.csr**) to [support@lobaro.de](mailto:support@lobaro.de) to receive a valid certificate for your Server.

### Install the signed Certificate in the Platform

Add or update the following keys in the Platform configuration file:

```yaml
server:
  dtlsConfig:
    dtlsCertDir: "./config" # This way the configuration directory is used to lookup the key and cert.
    dtlsCertName: "platform" # Used to lookup "platform.crt" and "platform.key"
featureToggle:
  dtlsSecureCoapServiceEnabled: true # removed in > v1.59.1
```

:::danger
We recommend to **not backup the `platform.key`** file. If it's lost, we can issue new certificates.

If you need to backup the key file make sure the backup is encrypted in a secure way.
:::




In case you choose another location than `./config` the `docker-compose.yml` must be updated to mount the `dtlsCertDir`:

```yaml
services:
  lobaro-backend:
    volumes:
      - </host/path/to/cert-dir>:<dtlsCertDir>
```



To apply the Configuration restart the Platfrom:

```bash
docker restart platform_lobaro-backend_1
```

:::tip
In case the commands fails with e.g.
`Error response from daemon: No such container: platform_lobaro-backend_1`

Execute

```
docker ps | grep lobaro
```

You should find the container that is running the platform. The restart command can be issued with the `CONTAINER ID` or `NAME`
