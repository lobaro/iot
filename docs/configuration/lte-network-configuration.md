# LTE Network Configuration

In order for the Lobaro devices to be able to dial into the mobile network, it may be necessary to configure the network
related parameters correctly.

:::info
Lobaro devices normally perform a network selection based on the profile stored on the SIM card inserted in the device.
This means that in most case the mobile `operator` and `band` **have
not** to be configured since the devices perform an autodetect based on internal metrics. In some cases it may be
beneficial
to set the device to use a specific operator, then the operator, and band configuration parameters of the device comes
into play.

In contrast to this the `apn` parameter should be set correctly in any case. The `*` (autodetect) feature will only work
for few sim cards, like **1NCE** and **Vodafone Easy Connect** SIM cards.
:::

## Configuration Parameters

Our cellular IoT (LTE-M or NB-IoT) devices usually allow the configuration of

### APN

* Should be configured to SIM specific value, e.g. `iot.1nce.net`
* Default: `*`
    * APN Autodetect -> Modem uses internally known APN
        * Will only work for 1NCE and Vodafone EasyConnect
    * APN autodetect not possible: Modem falls back to `Not set` (see below)
* `Not set` -> Modem uses SIM internal information

### Operator

* Usually **no need** to configure it explicitly to some specific MCC+MNC operator code like `26201`
* Default: `Not set` -> Modem performs automatic network selection

### Band

* Usually **no need** to configure it explicitly
* Default: `Not set` -> Modem will use one of these bands `3,8,20`

:::note
`Not set` denotes that the configuration parameter field is empty.
:::

:::warning
If you decide to configure the `operator` and/or `band` you may decrease the devices coverage and ability to find
alternative networks at a specific location. Use this configuration parameters only if you know what you are doing!
:::

For initial configuration of these parameters please use the [Lobaro Maintenance Tool](./lobaro-config-tool.md).

## List of common APN and Operators

* MCC = Mobile Country Code
* MNC = Mobile Network Code
* Operator = MCC+MNC (Config Parameter for Lobaro Devices)
