# Introduction

Lobaro devices allow a wide range of configuration adjustments.
This page describes the some generally valid parameters that are used in the same way for Lobaro devices,
although not all products have to support all parameters listed here.
All configuration parameters are stored non-volatile in the Lobaro devices.

Device-specific parameters are explained in the respective documentation.

## How to configure

Any Lobaro device configuration can be set and read out either locally via a PC with the [Lobaro configuration USB
adapter](./usb-cfg-adapter) and the [Lobaro Maintenance Tool](./lobaro-tool/index.md) or remotely when using the Lobaro IoT platform and mobile radio (NB-IoT, LTE-M)
or any LoRaWAN network server using downlinks on a special port. Network parameters, such as the APN of the mobile
cellular network provider, must usually first be configured correctly locally.

Alternatively, possible on request for
larger orders, an customer specific configuration agreed with the customer can also be installed by Lobaro during
production provisioning.
